# FootBall_Results_Analytics
This project demonstrates analytics of football results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1972 up to 2019. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. In this project I have done an in-depth analysis of the football match results and performed EDA on the football results data to uncover lots of hidden insights related to football matches. Cluster analysis is performed to observe the year wise trend of matches won by different teams. Feature engineering is performed to generate meta-features for analyzing the different aspect of football results.
